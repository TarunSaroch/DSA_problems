"""
Find the first or last occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Given a sorted integer array, find the index of a given numberâ€™s first or last occurrence. If the element is not present in the array, report that as well.

For example,
Input: nums = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]       target = 5 
Output:
The first occurrence of element 5 is located at index 1
The last occurrence of element 5 is located at index 3

Input: nums = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]       target = 4
Output:
-1
